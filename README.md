TV Analytics

By Shubhanshu Yadav


In order to test the website using the flask development server first execute setyp.py (sets up the python virtual evironment) and then run.py


Once the server is running go to localhost:5000 or localhost:5000/searchSeries

Enter the name of a TV show in the text box. 

If you entered a show that you have not searched for before a webcrawler will collect all the information about the TV series you entered (this may take some time). Otherwise the information previously stored is used

Now you will be shown a graph that plots the ratings of all the episodes of the TV show. 

The points in the graph are colour coded by season.

Some information about an episode can be viewed by placing the mouse over the respective point in the graph. 

Clicking on the point redirects you to a webpage containing the links where the episode can be watched online.
